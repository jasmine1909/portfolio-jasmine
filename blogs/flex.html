    <h2>Basic term</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>main axis – The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the flex-direction property (see below).</li>
        <li>main-start | main-end – The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.</li>
        <li>main size – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.</li>
        <li>cross axis – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.</li>
        <li>cross-start | cross-end – Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.</li>
        <li>cross size – The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’ that is in the cross dimension.</li>


    </ul>
    <h2>Flex properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flex direction: This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.</li>
        <li>Flex-grow: This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.

            If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, that child would take up twice as much of the space either one of the others (or it will try, at least). </li>
        <li>Flex-wrap: By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.</li>
        <li>Flex-shrink: This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary. </li>
        <li>Flex-flow: This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.</li>
        <li>Flex-basis: This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size ).</li>
