    <h2>What is a closure?</h2>
    <p>A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables — a scope chain.
        The closure has three scope chains:
        <ul>
         <li>it has access to its own scope — variables defined between its curly brackets</li>
        <li>it has access to the outer function’s variables</li>
        <li>it has access to the global variables</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>Closures are useful because they let you associate data (the lexical environment) with a function that operates on that data. This has obvious parallels to object-oriented programming, where objects allow you to associate data (the object's properties) with one or more methods.

        Consequently, you can use a closure anywhere that you might normally use an object with only a single method.
        
        Situations where you might want to do this are particularly common on the web. Much of the code written in front-end JavaScript is event-based. You define some behavior, and then attach it to an event that is triggered by the user (such as a click or a keypress). The code is attached as a callback (a single function that is executed in response to the event).</p>
    <h2>Closure Scope Chain</h2>
    <p>Every closure has three scopes:
        <ul>
            <li>Local Scope (Own scope)</li>
            <li>Outer Functions Scope</li>
            <li>Global Scope</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
