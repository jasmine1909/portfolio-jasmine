        <h1 class="title-info">CSS Media Queries</h1>
        <h2>Do you really need CSS media queries?</h2>
        <p>Media queries are a powerful tool in your CSS toolbox with exciting hidden gems. But if you accomodate your design to every possible situation you’ll end up with a codebase that’s too complex to maintain and, as we all know, CSS is like a bear cub: cute and inoffensive but when it grows it will eat you alive.</p>
        <h2>Media types</h2>
        <ul>Media types describe the general category of a device. Except when using the not or only logical operators, the media type is optional and the all type is implied.
    
           <li> all: Suitable for all devices.</li>
            
            <li>print: Intended for paged material and documents viewed on a screen in print preview mode. (Please see paged media for information about formatting issues that are specific to these formats.)
                </li>
            <li>screen: Intended primarily for screens.</li></ul>
        
        <h2>Using min- and max- to match value ranges</h2>
        <p>Many of the media features outlined in the previous section — including width, height, color and color-index — can be prefixed with min- or max- to express minimum or maximum constraints. We’ve already seen these in use throughout many of the examples, but the point is that we can create a range of value to match instead of having to declare specific values.</p>
        <h2>Nesting and complex decision making</h2>
        <p>CSS allows you to nest at-rules or group statements using parentheses, making it possible to go as deep as we want to evaluate complex operations.
    
            @media (min-width: 20em), not all and (min-height: 40em) {  
              @media not all and (pointer: none) { ... }
              @media screen and ( (min-width: 50em) and (orientation: landscape) ), print and ( not (color) ) { ... }
            }</p>
